# e-mail-bomber
An e-mail bomber that spams mails to a chosen e-mail over smtp

All libraries are preinstalled by default so all you need is python on your computer and a generated app password to use this tool. You must generate an app password which is pretty easy. I will list a youtube tutorial at the bottom of this readme.

IF YOU USE e-mail bomber for gmail.py

The senders e-mail must be gmail, but the receivers e-mail provider doesnt have to be gmail. The reason for that is because yahoo for some reason does not support or hasnt fixed their app password issue. For some reason I also couldnt make app passwords on outlook (probably because I was using a school email). 

IF YOU USE bomber.py

If yahoo decides to fix the app password issue in the future or you can create app passwords on outlook, the other file "bomber.py" supports yahoo and outlook usage. Make sure the right ports are being used.
